## Lecture Notes
### Lecture : Api and Package structuring
API'S : Api's are the endpoints that other developers can use to interact with your system.
They can change the internal state of the system using these api's or they can get to know about the internal state of the system using these api's
There is no other way to connect to your system except using api
That restricts the amount of interactions that different systems can have with our system
